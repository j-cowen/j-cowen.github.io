			<h2>Project summary</h2>

			<p>A project that utilizes Excel to clean messy data for an office supply chain. The refined data is subsequently
				used to construct pivot tables to facilitate efficient data analysis. The outcomes of this analysis are then
				showcased in an interactive Excel dashboard. Skills used include VLOOKUP, INDEX MATCH, RANDARRAY, SEQUENCE,
				aggregate functions, pivot tables, charts, and slicers.</p>

			<h2>Skills used</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>VLOOKUP, INDEX MATCH, RANDARRAY, SEQUENCE, and aggregate functions.</li>
				<li>Tabular Pivot Tables to create new source data.</li>
				<li>Pivot bar charts, column charts, tree maps, and choropleth maps, combined with slicers to enhance
					interactivity in the dashboard.</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Data sources</h2>
			<span>Customer / Account data:</span>
			<ul>
				<li>Sourced using ChatGPT.</li>
				<li>Prior to commencing this portfolio project, I had completed a comprehensive data cleaning project at work. I
					felt that the dataset's format was an excellent example to showcase my skills, so I enlisted ChatGPT's help to
					generate synthetic data in the same format.</li>
			</ul>

			<span>Sales data:</span>
			<ul>
				<li>Sourced from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fehmifratpolat/sales-data">Kaggle</a> in a clean
					format. </li>
				<li>All customer detail was removed from the dataset. To link the Sales data from Kaggle to the Customer /
					Account data from Chat GPT, I used RANDARRAY to apply a Customer Number to each sales transaction.</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Project goal</h2>
			<p>Create an interactive dashboard to examine historical sales trends spanning multiple years. The dashboard
				should feature key metrics such as sales, profit, number of orders, and profit margin. Additionally, it should
				provide a clear visualization of sales distribution based on region and category, offering valuable insights
				into the geographical and product-specific sources of revenue.</p>

			<h2>Steps</h2>
			<h4>Step 1: Customer / Account data quality observations</h4>
			<ol type="A">
				<li>Each row represents a unique account, with data consolidated into a single cell and separated using a '|'
					delimiter.</li>
				<li>Extra spaces across the entire dataset.</li>
				<li>Improper case and spelling errors in Shipping City, State, and Country. Inconsistent references (full word
					vs. two-digit code) and occasional null values in Shipping State and Country fields. Shipping Region column is
					missing.</li>
				<li>Names and email of up to four people are spread across multiple columns within a single row. </li>
				<li>Inconsistent data types within columns (i.e. account number is a mix of text and number format).</li>
			</ol>

			<h4>Step 2A: Converting Customer / Account data into table format</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>Selected all data within the "Raw_customer_data" worksheet and used the "Text to Columns" Wizard to split
					the values across columns based on the '|' delimiter.</li>
				<li>Converted the data into a table.</li>
				<li>The "Customer_cleaning_pt_1" worksheet shows the Customer / Account data in table format.</li>
			</ul>

			<h4>Step 2B: Removing extra spaces</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>Within the "Customer_cleaning_pt_1" worksheet, applied TRIM(CLEAN()) to the entire dataset to remove extra
					spaces and potential line breaks and non-printable characters.</li>
			</ul>

			<h4>Step 2C: Cleaning shipping address fields</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>Performed the following for each shipping address column:
					<ul>
						<li>Within the "Pivot_tables_shipping_address" worksheet, created a pivot table to consolidate the various
							spelling discrepancies.</li>
						<li>In the adjacent column to the pivot table, entered the refined version of the field, ensuring it was
							free
							of spelling errors and written in full City/State/Country format.</li>
						<li>Within the "Customer_cleaning_pt_1" worksheet, created new Shipping City, State, and Country columns to
							house the cleaned shipping data.</li>
						<li>Used VLOOKUPS to populate the new columns with the cleaned data.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Populated all null values within the Shipping State and Country columns, using City as a guide.</li>
				<li>Created a new column to house the Shipping Region. Populated the column using a VLOOKUP that referenced a
					table of all States and their associated Region.</li>
				<li>Duplicated the "Customer_cleaning_pt_1" worksheet and named it "Customer_account_data_CLEAN". Removed the
					old Shipping City, State, and Country columns.</li>
			</ul>

			<h4>Step 2D: Shifting all details for Person 1/2/3 from columns to individual rows</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>Within the "Pivot_tables_customer_1_2_3" worksheet, created tabular pivot tables for Person 1/2/3, mirroring
					the first 11 columns of the Contact / Account table.</li>
				<li>Appended all data from these pivot tables to the table in the "Customer_account_data_CLEAN" worksheet.</li>
				<li>Deleted the superfluous columns housing name and email for Person 1/2/3.</li>
				<li>Identified and eliminated duplicate email addresses using the highlight duplicates conditional formatting
					tool.</li>
				<li>Created a new column called "Customer Number", then applied a surrogate key to each row using SEQUENCE.</li>
			</ul>

			<h4>Step 2E: Applying consistent data types to each column</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>Applied "Number" data type to the "Customer Number" column.</li>
				<li>Applied "Text" data type to all other columns.</li>
				<li>The Contacts / Accounts data is now clean.</li>
			</ul>

			<h4>Step 3: Joining the Customer / Account data table with the Sales data table</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>Within the Sales data table in the "Transaction_data_CLEAN" worksheet, created a new column called "Customer
					Number". Used RANDARRAY to apply a Customer Number from the Customer / Account data to each sales transaction.
					This represents the person who submitted the online order.</li>
				<li>Duplicated the "Transaction_data_CLEAN" worksheet and named it "Combined_source_data_FINAL". Created
					placeholder columns for all customer data associated with the Customer Number (e.g. name, email, account,
					etc).</li>
				<li>Using Customer Number as the common key, employed INDEX MATCH to populate customer details in the Sales data
					table, emulating a LEFT JOIN with the Customer / Account data table.</li>
			</ul>

			<h4>Step 4: Creating the dashboard</h4>
			<p>Based on the project goal, I understood that the dashboard should highlight sales, profit, order count, and
				profit margin over time, categorized by region and category.</p>

			<p>First I sketched out a wireframe of the dashboard to understand how each element could fit together. Then I
				began to create each dashboard element one by one. My exposure to dynamic arrays was quite limited at that point
				in time, so I chose to build the dashboard off pivot tables, pivot charts, and slicers.</p>

			<p>For the final touch I applied formatting to the dashboard, ensuring that I used complimentary colors and subtle
				contrast to improve readability.</p>

			<h2>Insights</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Total Profit, Profit Margin, and Number of Orders exhibit annual increases, signaling a positive outlook for
					the future of Essential Office Supplies. Additionally, Q4 continues to experience higher sales compared to
					Q1-Q3 year on year.</li>

				<li>The Technology category leads in sales for three out of four years, with the Phones subcategory making the
					most significant contribution each year. Nevertheless, overall sales across categories exhibit a relatively
					even distribution annually.</li>

				<li>At the state level, California and Texas consistently lead in sales each year, likely contributing to the
					West and South regions having the highest overall sales each year as well.</li>

				<li>While the top 5 products fluctuate yearly, a Canon-manufactured copier secures a position in three out of
					four years. Collectively, these top 5 products contribute 10% - 13% to total sales each year.</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Project reflection</h2>
			<p>In my role at IonOpticks, I successfully completed numerous Excel data cleaning projects so I was well-versed
				in executing steps 1 to 3 of this project.</p>

			<p>My progress hit a snag when I commenced the dashboard construction phase. The concept of dynamic arrays was
				relatively unfamiliar to me, and I found it challenging to make a choice between using dynamic arrays or pivot
				tables to calculate the KPIs. In the end, I decided to go with the familiar terrain of pivot tables and slicers
				for the initial iteration of the dashboard.</p>

			<p>Given more time, I would have explored the use of dynamic arrays to enhance my understanding of them and to
				better understand their strengths and weaknesses compared to pivot tables when building a dynamic dashboard.
			</p>

			<p>In the future, my intention is to recreate the same dashboard using dynamic arrays to calculate the KPIs.</p>
