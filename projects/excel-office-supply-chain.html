			<h1 style="margin-top: 0.5em;">Excel-ing in Data Harmony</h1>

			<p>When I kicked off this Excel project, my aim was to clean sales and customer data for a fictional office supply chain named Essential Office Supplies (EOS), then develop an interactive dashboard to analyze historical sales trends across multiple years. I envisioned the dashboard displaying key metrics like sales, profit, number of orders, and profit margin. Furthermore, I wanted it to offer a clear visualization of sales distribution by region and category, providing insights into revenue sources based on geography and product categories.</p>
			<p>In the first iteration of the project, I utilized pivot tables to compute the KPIs and constructed the dashboard with pivot charts and slicers.</p>
			<p>Upon learning advanced dynamic array functions, I opted to recalculate the KPIs using dynamic arrays. Subsequently, I rebuilt the dashboard using charts and form controls.</p>
			
			<h2>Skills used</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Version 1: VLOOKUP, INDEX MATCH, RANDARRAY, SEQUENCE, and aggregate functions.</li>
				<li>Version 2: FILTER, UNIQUE, SORT, TRANSPOSE, SUMPRODUCT, XLOOKUP, SUMIFS</li>
				<li>Tabular Pivot Tables to create new source data.</li>
				<li>Bar charts, column charts, tree maps, and choropleth maps, combined with slicers and form controls to enhance interactivity.</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Data sources</h2>
			<span>Customer / Account data:</span>
			<ul>
				<li>Sourced using ChatGPT.</li>
				<li>Prior to commencing this portfolio project, I had completed a comprehensive data cleaning project at work. I
					felt that the dataset's format was an excellent example to showcase my skills, so I enlisted ChatGPT's help to
					generate synthetic data in the same format.</li>
			</ul>

			<span>Sales data:</span>
			<ul>
				<li>Sourced from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fehmifratpolat/sales-data">Kaggle</a> in a clean
					format. </li>
				<li>All customer detail was removed from the dataset. To link the Sales data from Kaggle to the Customer /
					Account data from Chat GPT, I used RANDARRAY to apply a Customer Number to each sales transaction.</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Steps</h2>
			<h4>Step 1: Customer / Account data quality observations</h4>
			<ol type="A">
				<li>Each row represents a unique account, with data consolidated into a single cell and separated using a '|'
					delimiter.</li>
				<li>Extra spaces across the entire dataset.</li>
				<li>Improper case and spelling errors in Shipping City, State, and Country. Inconsistent references (full word
					vs. two-digit code) and occasional null values in Shipping State and Country fields. Shipping Region column is
					missing.</li>
				<li>Names and email of up to four people are spread across multiple columns within a single row. </li>
				<li>Inconsistent data types within columns (i.e. account number is a mix of text and number format).</li>
			</ol>

			<h4>Step 2A: Converting Customer / Account data into table format</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>Selected all data within the "Raw_customer_data" worksheet and used the "Text to Columns" Wizard to split
					the values across columns based on the '|' delimiter.</li>
				<li>Converted the data into a table.</li>
				<li>The "Customer_cleaning_pt_1" worksheet shows the Customer / Account data in table format.</li>
			</ul>

			<h4>Step 2B: Removing extra spaces</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>Within the "Customer_cleaning_pt_1" worksheet, applied TRIM(CLEAN()) to the entire dataset to remove extra
					spaces and potential line breaks and non-printable characters.</li>
			</ul>

			<h4>Step 2C: Cleaning shipping address fields</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>Performed the following for each shipping address column:
					<ul>
						<li>Within the "Pivot_tables_shipping_address" worksheet, created a pivot table to consolidate the various
							spelling discrepancies.</li>
						<li>In the adjacent column to the pivot table, entered the refined version of the field, ensuring it was
							free
							of spelling errors and written in full City/State/Country format.</li>
						<li>Within the "Customer_cleaning_pt_1" worksheet, created new Shipping City, State, and Country columns to
							house the cleaned shipping data.</li>
						<li>Used VLOOKUPS to populate the new columns with the cleaned data.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Populated all null values within the Shipping State and Country columns, using City as a guide.</li>
				<li>Created a new column to house the Shipping Region. Populated the column using a VLOOKUP that referenced a
					table of all States and their associated Region.</li>
				<li>Duplicated the "Customer_cleaning_pt_1" worksheet and named it "Customer_account_data_CLEAN". Removed the
					old Shipping City, State, and Country columns.</li>
			</ul>

			<h4>Step 2D: Shifting all details for Person 1/2/3 from columns to individual rows</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>Within the "Pivot_tables_customer_1_2_3" worksheet, created tabular pivot tables for Person 1/2/3, mirroring
					the first 11 columns of the Contact / Account table.</li>
				<li>Appended all data from these pivot tables to the table in the "Customer_account_data_CLEAN" worksheet.</li>
				<li>Deleted the superfluous columns housing name and email for Person 1/2/3.</li>
				<li>Identified and eliminated duplicate email addresses using the highlight duplicates conditional formatting
					tool.</li>
				<li>Created a new column called "Customer Number", then applied a surrogate key to each row using SEQUENCE.</li>
			</ul>

			<h4>Step 2E: Applying consistent data types to each column</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>Applied "Number" data type to the "Customer Number" column.</li>
				<li>Applied "Text" data type to all other columns.</li>
				<li>The Contacts / Accounts data is now clean.</li>
			</ul>

			<h4>Step 3: Joining the Customer / Account data table with the Sales data table</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>Within the Sales data table in the "Transaction_data_CLEAN" worksheet, created a new column called "Customer
					Number". Used RANDARRAY to apply a Customer Number from the Customer / Account data to each sales transaction.
					This represents the person who submitted the online order.</li>
				<li>Duplicated the "Transaction_data_CLEAN" worksheet and named it "Combined_source_data_FINAL". Created
					placeholder columns for all customer data associated with the Customer Number (e.g. name, email, account,
					etc).</li>
				<li>Using Customer Number as the common key, employed INDEX MATCH to populate customer details in the Sales data
					table, emulating a LEFT JOIN with the Customer / Account data table.</li>
			</ul>

			<h4>Step 4: Creating the dashboard</h4>
			
			<p>With the project goal in mind, my aim was to spotlight sales, profit, order count, and profit margin trends over time, segmented by region and category.</p>
			<p>To start, I created a wireframe of the dashboard layout to visualize the arrangement of each component. Then, I systematically built each dashboard element. At the project's outset, my familiarity with dynamic arrays was limited, so I initially relied on pivot tables, pivot charts, and slicers to calculate the KPIs and construct the dashboard. The calculations and dashboard for this phase can be found on the tabs 'KPIs_v1' and 'Dashboard_v1' within the Excel file located in the project repository.</p>
			<p>After learning advanced dynamic array functions, I applied my newfound skills to recalculate the KPIs using functions instead of pivot tables. The calculations and dashboard for this new iteration can be found on the tabs 'KPIs_v2' and 'Dashboard_v2' within the Excel file located in the project repository.</p>
			<p>For the final touch I applied formatting to the dashboard, ensuring that I used complimentary colors and subtle contrast to improve readability.</p>


			<h2>Insights</h2>
			<p>Refer to the 'Dashboard_v2' tab in the <a href="https://github.com/j-cowen/portfolio-projects/blob/main/exceling-in-data-harmony/EOS%20Sales%20Dashboard_v2.xlsx">Excel file</a> located in the <a href="https://github.com/j-cowen/portfolio-projects/tree/main/exceling-in-data-harmony">project repository</a> to view the dashboard from which insights were derived.</p>
			
			<ul>
				<li>Total Profit, Profit Margin, and Number of Orders exhibit annual increases, signaling a positive outlook for
					the future of Essential Office Supplies. Additionally, Q4 continues to experience higher sales compared to
					Q1-Q3 year on year.</li>

				<li>The Technology category leads in sales for three out of four years, with the Phones subcategory making the
					most significant contribution each year. Nevertheless, overall sales across categories exhibit a relatively
					even distribution annually.</li>

				<li>At the state level, California and Texas consistently lead in sales each year, likely contributing to the
					West and South regions having the highest overall sales each year as well.</li>

				<li>While the top 5 products fluctuate yearly, a Canon-manufactured copier secures a position in three out of
					four years. Collectively, these top 5 products contribute 10% - 13% to total sales each year.</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Project reflection</h2>

			<p>In my role at IonOpticks, I successfully completed numerous data cleaning projects using Excel so I was well-versed in executing steps 1 to 3 of this project.</p>
			<p>However, my progress slowed when I transitioned to the dashboard construction phase. The options for this phase were pivot tables and dynamic arrays. I had little experience with dynamic arrays so I opted for the familiar territory of pivot tables for the initial version of the dashboard. This allowed me to meet the project aims quickly and produce a product that I could then review and improve on.</p>
			<p>With a dashboard in place, I took the opportunity to learn more about dynamic arrays and compare their effectiveness against pivot tables. Once I started to re-implement the dashboard the benefits of the dynamic arrays began to show immediately. They allowed me to simplify my approach, offering much greater control over the calculations and were much more flexible than pivot tables.</p>
