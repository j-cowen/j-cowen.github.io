			<p>To kick off this Udacity SQL Nanodegree project, I received a dataset containing user information, user posts,
				votes on user posts, and user comments, organized into two distinct tables. The project goal was to:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Investigate the existing schema</li>
				<li>Create the DDL for a new schema</li>
				<li>Migrate the existing data into the new schema using DML</li>
				<li>Using DQL to query the new schema, address a set of prompts from Udacity to understand user behavior,
					comments on posts, and votes on posts.</li>
			</ol>

			<h2>Skills used</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>DDL commands
					<ul>
						<li>CREATE TABLE</li>
						<li>CREATE INDEX</li>
						<li>ALTER TABLE</li>
						<li>UNIQUE, PRIMARY KEY, FOREIGN KEY, and CHECK constraints</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>DML commands
					<ul>
						<li>SELECT</li>
						<li>INSERT</li>
						<li>UPDATE</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>DQL commands
					<ul>
						<li>Left Joins, Inner Joins and Self Joins</li>
						<li>Creating Views</li>
						<li>CTE's</li>
						<li>Aggregate Functions</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h2>Data source</h2>
			<p>The dataset was provided as part of <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/learn-sql--nd072">Udacity's SQL Nanodegree program.</a></p>

			<h2>Steps</h2>
			<p>The project goal steps outlined above have been captured and addressed in a <a
					href="https://github.com/j-cowen/portfolio-projects/blob/main/revitalizing-a-social-news-aggregator/udiddit-project.sql">SQL
					file</a> in the project repository. Comments have been included to explain what each SQL statement is trying
				to achieve.</p>

			<h2>Insights</h2>
			<p>Refer to the <a href="">PDF file</a> in the project repository to view a summary of findings.</p>

			<h2>Project reflection</h2>
			<p>Prior to this course, my primary strength lay in Excel. During this project, I struggled with not being able to
				see and navigate data as effortlessly in SQL as I could in Excel. Although I found the DML portion of the
				project to be straightforward, I often questioned whether I was migrating the data accurately. Part of my
				discomfort may have stemmed from the constraints of the small Postgres interface within Udacity, which hindered
				my ability to easily visualize a substantial amount of data on the screen. Nonetheless, I am confident that this
				discomfort will quickly fade as I gain more SQL experience.</p>
